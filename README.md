# cautious-eureka-HGR
This file requires
python, mediapipe, opencv, and pyautogui
install python 3.10.0 from python.org and go through the releases
for mediapipe do
pip install mediapipe==0.10.21
for opencv do
pip install opencv-python

the following versions run well with old hardware for version 3 of cautious-eureka if the cursor is not moving smoothly you can edit that by editing the foolowin line 
"cursor_smoothing = 0.5 " lower than=smoother higher but it doesn't work if the value is 0.1 0.5 should be smooth enough otherwise may cause some errors.
